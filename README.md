This repository is for the following Medium <a href="https://medium.com/@anirudhsekar2008/building-a-convolutional-neural-network-cnn-to-classify-cifar-10-images-d581901c471d">article</a> where we go over how to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Tensorflow and how to apply it to the CIFAR-10 Dataset on real world objects. Feel free to visit the Medium article for a more step-by-step approach.
